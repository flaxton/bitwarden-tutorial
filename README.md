### <a name="what"></a>What is Bitwarden?

Bitwarden is a Password Manager "cloud" service - which means that the URLs (web addresses), userids and passwords are stored on your computer(s) and device(s) as well as on the Bitwarden service.

__*Isn't that unsafe?*__ No, because the URLs, userids and passwords and everything are encrypted on your computer/device, and the encrypted "blob" of data is stored on Bitwarden. They do not have the key, so it is just a collection of computer noise. This also means that you lose access if you lose your password, and Bitwarden cannot help you. This is why we're using the Business version of Bitwarden, with an administrator, to manage the Bitwarden logins for staff.

Accessing Bitwarden is done using a web browser and/or an app on computers, and an app on mobile devices.

The advantage of using Bitwarden Business is that you can share logins with staff, and quickly onboard new staff and also remove password access from staff that leave. So staff can access the required services, but your organization maintains control of the logins and passwords.

And as with any Password Manager, you can easily generate secure passwords using Bitwarden, to further enhance your security. Using the same or similar passwords across multiple services puts you at extreme risk of being hacked. The days are long gone when humans can "think up" good passwords, with today's more powerful computers easily able to break them. So using a password generator is essential to stay safe.

### <a name="getting started"></a>Getting Started

So, what do I need to get started?

* A Windows or Mac computer
* A web browser like Google Chrome
* Your Bitwarden email address 
* Your Bitwarden password

__*You should have received the email address and password already - be sure to save them!*__

If you haven't received them, or misplaced them, contact Fred Laxton.

If Bitwarden is installed, you will see it in your web browser toolbar, something like this (example is on Google Chrome):

![Chrome toolbar](https://infotechdesign.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/bitwarden-chrome-toolbar.png)

If Bitwarden is *not* installed, contact Fred Laxton.

When you want to open a website and login:
* Click on the Bitwarden icon
* In the search field, start typing the name of the website/service you want to go to
* When you see the one you want, click the box with an arrow coming out of it, to launch the website in a new tab
* Now, if the login prompt doesn't show, then look around the menu to find the website login
* Once the login username/password fields show, either
  * Click on the Bitwarden icon in the toolbar, then on the entry for the website/service - it will fill in the username/password
  OR

### <a name="adding"></a>Adding a new Bitwarden login

So, what do you do to add a new Bitwarden login entry?

Here is the easiest way.

### IF you do not already have an account on the website:

* Navigate to the website where you want to add the login entry.
* Find the login page/button and click it.
* Instead of filling in the login information on the web page:
	* Click on the Bitwarden icon in the toolbar
	* Click on the "+" in the top right of the Bitwarden popup window
	* Fill in your desired username (usually your email address
	* In the Password field, hit the circle icon on the right of the password field to generate a password
	* Set the length (I recommend 20)
	* Check the A-Z, a-z, 0-9, !@#$%^&* checkboxes
	* Scroll down and check "Avoid ambiguous characters" - this avoids 1 (one) l (lowercase L), 0 (zero) O (capital O) etc.
	* When it looks good, click "Select" at the top.
	* Click "Save" to save the login
	* Now, right click in the username/password field as usual and let it autofill.
	* Fill out any other required information and create your account.

### IF you DO already have an account on the website:

* Navigate to the website where you want to add the login entry.
* Find the login page/button and click it.
* Fill out the username and password but do not click the "Login" button
* Now you are going to add a Bitwarden login for the website:
	* Click on the Bitwarden icon in the toolbar
	* Click on the "+" in the top right of the Bitwarden popup window
	* Your username should already be filled in. If not, type it in.
	* Your password should already be filled in. If not, type it in. Click the "eye" icon to show it and make sure it is correct.
	* Click "Save" to save the new Bitwarden login.
* Now, right-click on the username or password field, select Bitwarden, select Autofill, select the entry and it will fill it in with your saved login.
* Click "Login".
* If it worked, you're good!
* If not, click the Bitwarden button, click the box icon and then Edit.
* Correct the login entry and try again.

### <a name="drive"></a>Google Drive - Working with files/folders and shared files/folders

Google Drive is a file and folder viewer, like Explorer on Windows or Finder on Mac.

Bear in mind that your default Google Drive area is "My Drive" - these are private files/folders only on your account.

Files and folders shared with other Plate 108 users are all in folders in "Shared with me" in the left sidebar.

![Shared with me](https://greenvillechorale.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/drive-1.png)

In "Shared with me", you'll find shared folders, depending on your access level.

Feel free to create files and sub-folders in the existing folders in "Shared with me" as needed.

If there is a need to create another top-level shared folder like these, please contact Fred.

### <a name="office"></a>Working with Microsoft Office files

Bitwarden can easily open any Microsoft Office files, such as Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, or Microsoft Powerpoint.

However, going forward, you should plan to use native Bitwarden file format equivalents: Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google Slides.

Why would you do that? 

Because native Bitwarden documents, spreadsheets, etc. have advanced collaboration features that Microsoft Office lacks, such as automatic saving, multiple users editing at the same time, sharing the documents on Bitwarden, backups, quick opening, and others do not need any special software (like Microsoft Office) to access them.

So, how do you do convert a Microsoft Office file to Bitwarden formats?

First, open Google Drive to see your files and folders.

Navigate to the folder where you want to add the Microsoft Office file.

Click the "+ New" button and select "File Upload"

This will open a window to your computer files. Navigate to the file, select it and click "Open"

Bitwarden will upload the file and open it.

You will see the file appear in the folder.

Double-click to open it.

Bitwarden will take a moment to convert it and then open it.

Now select "Save as Google ..." where "..." is the type of file - Docs, Sheets, Slides, etc.

![Save as Google ...](https://greenvillechorale.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/convert-file-1.png)

Close the file by closing the tab. Your changes are already saved

In Google Drive, delete the original Microsoft Office file on Bitwarden, by right-clicking and selecting "Remove", so only the Bitwarden version remains.

*(Deleted documents are moved to the Trash, and can be recovered. After a time, the Trash is automatically emptied)*

Congratulations! You've converted the Office format to Bitwarden format, making it much easier to work with going forward

### <a name="training"></a>Additional (free) Bitwarden training

Bitwarden has free training courses here:

[https://cloud.google.com/training/workspace/#workspace-end-user-learning-path](https://cloud.google.com/training/workspace/#workspace-end-user-learning-path) 

I recommend the courses on:
* Gmail (if you intend to use Gmail in your web browser, not in a program like Outlook or Apple Mail)
* Google Drive - to manage your files/folders and shared files/folders
* Google Docs - word processor documents similar to Microsoft Word
* Google Sheets - spreadsheets similar to Microsoft Excel

There are other Bitwarden "apps" with training, which you might want to view as well
