### <a name="what"></a>What is Bitwarden?

Bitwarden is a Password Manager "cloud" service - which means that the URLs (web addresses), userids and passwords are stored on your computer(s) and device(s) as well as on the Bitwarden service.

__*Isn't that unsafe?*__ No, because the URLs, userids and passwords and everything are encrypted on your computer/device, and the encrypted "blob" of data is stored on Bitwarden. They do not have the key, so it is just a collection of computer noise. This also means that you lose access if you lose your password, and Bitwarden cannot help you. This is why we're using the Business version of Bitwarden, with an administrator, to manage the Bitwarden logins for staff.

Accessing Bitwarden is done using a web browser and/or an app on computers, and an app on mobile devices.

The advantage of using Bitwarden Business is that you can share logins with staff, and quickly onboard new staff and also remove password access from staff that leave. So staff can access the required services, but your organization maintains control of the logins and passwords.

And as with any Password Manager, you can easily generate secure passwords using Bitwarden, to further enhance your security. Using the same or similar passwords across multiple services puts you at extreme risk of being hacked. The days are long gone when humans can "think up" good passwords, with today's more powerful computers easily able to break them. So using a password generator is essential to stay safe.

__*You should have received the email address and password already - be sure to save them!*__

If you haven't received them, or misplaced them, contact Fred Laxton.

If Bitwarden is installed, you will see it in your web browser toolbar, something like this (example is on Google Chrome):

### <a name="adding"></a>Adding a new Bitwarden login

So, what do you do to add a new Bitwarden login entry?

Here is the easiest way.

### IF you do not already have an account on the website:

* Navigate to the website where you want to add the login entry.
* Find the login page/button and click it.
* Instead of filling in the login information on the web page:
	* Click on the Bitwarden icon in the toolbar
	* Click on the "+" in the top right of the Bitwarden popup window
	* Fill in your desired username (usually your email address
	* In the Password field, hit the circle icon on the right of the password field to generate a password
	* Set the length (I recommend 20)
	* Check the A-Z, a-z, 0-9, !@#$%^&* checkboxes
	* Scroll down and check "Avoid ambiguous characters" - this avoids 1 (one) l (lowercase L), 0 (zero) O (capital O) etc.
	* When it looks good, click "Select" at the top.
	* Click "Save" to save the login
	* Now, right click in the username/password field as usual and let it autofill.
	* Fill out any other required information and create your account.

### IF you DO already have an account on the website:

* Navigate to the website where you want to add the login entry.
* Find the login page/button and click it.
* Fill out the username and password but do not click the "Login" button
* Now you are going to add a Bitwarden login for the website:
	* Click on the Bitwarden icon in the toolbar
	* Click on the "+" in the top right of the Bitwarden popup window
	* Your username should already be filled in. If not, type it in.
	* Your password should already be filled in. If not, type it in. Click the "eye" icon to show it and make sure it is correct.
	* Click "Save" to save the new Bitwarden login.
* Now, right-click on the username or password field, select Bitwarden, select Autofill, select the entry and it will fill it in with your saved login.
* Click "Login".
* If it worked, you're good!
* If not, click the Bitwarden button, click the box icon and then Edit.
* Correct the login entry and try again.
